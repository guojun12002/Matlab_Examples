   Release R2009B thorugh 2012A Compliant Analog and Mixed Signal Examples
   
   To install this collection of Analog and Mixed Signal examples, please do the following: 

   1) Create a directory at the top level of a disk partition and name it AMS eg d:\ams  (it must be named AMS!)
   2) Unzip the AMS_R2009B.zip file into this directory.  As a result of this, seven subdirectories should be created. 
   3) Open MATLAB and ADD the AMS directory top the TOP of your MATLAB path. You only need to add this one directory. 
      OR simply browse to the AMS directory.  
   4) Type AMS at the MATLAB command prompt and the Example Navigator will open. 

   To run all of these examples, the following products are required: 

  MATLAB
      Signal Processing Toolbox
      RF Toolbox
      Communication Toolbox

  Simulink
      Signal Processing Blockset (DSP System Toolbox)
      Communication Toolbox      (Communications System Toolbox)
      SimPower Systems
      RF Blockset                (SimRF)
  
      
  NOTE: If you want to install this package in a directory other than "ams",  you will need to edit 
  both the ams.m file and the AMS_sel.txt file.
